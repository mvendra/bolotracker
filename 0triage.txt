* Add exception testing for violated constraints too

[
@finish the model design and api
* Plus additional helpers: list everything by name/pk (for example)
* welp, i suppose the TUI and others will have to use model to get pk's to reference where and what they wanna add
* i just need stuff like getPkByName, and etc - by the "secondary" pk's such as name, tag, etc.
* and listing is alot easier. list by name, by pk, whatever.
