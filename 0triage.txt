@mission statement
* a tool to allow people to "invest" time/money/assets onto projects, by tracking invested stuff.
]

[
@tech/arch
* mvc-like so i can replace frontends if need be
* will start with a console TUI
* will use sqlite, users should repo-around the dumped database file
* first strike: controller-and-view console, and the backend (model) using sqlite. that's it.

[
@features
* i wanna track hours worked, on what date, by whom, on what (kind of) activity
* also track how much money certain person invested
* also consider a more flexible field/table: assets provided (for bigger artwork, where hours worked are not available), or similar stuff - consider
 a third party who provided some sort of cover artwork, or logo, or even a software library or whatever - if the hours worked are lost, this could be a last resort.
