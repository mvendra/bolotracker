* mission statement: this is to allow people to "bid" hours and time onto projects, with no guaranteed returns, by tracking spent time and money on it.

* also track how much money certain person invested
* also consider a more flexible field/table: assets provided (for bigger artwork, where hours worked are not available), or similar stuff - consider a third party who provided some sort of cover artwork, or logo, or even a software library or whatever - if the hours worked are lost, this could be a last resort.

@hours tracker
* For hours tracker: first complete a fully working version console plus backend only, with no dependency on ui whatsoever. Only then plugin a cegui/other ui. Maybe even on separate repos.
* will use sqlite, users should repo-around the dumped database file
* C++
* CEGUI, or others. see the pre-made repo
* publish it later
* Also make a console for the hours tracker app. Undependent of the gui frontend

///////////////////////////////////////////////

[
* roll out your own little gui tool to track hours, using c++ and CEGUI (1), fltk (2), wxwidgets (3), qt (4), tkinder+python (5)
* make it MVC-like so i can eventually replace the widgets library if ever necessary.
]

* i wanna track hours worked, on what date, by whom, on what (kind of) activity
