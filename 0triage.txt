* fix bolotracker makefile
* The basic bolotracker gui must show all three basic tables.

* welp, i suppose the TUI and others will have to use model to get pk's to reference where and what they wanna add

* Bolotracker should be organised to have bootstrap db templates. A minimalistic one, and room for more sophisticated ones.
* i want to at least have a GUI viewer, in FLTK. if its too much trouble to add any read operations, then just
create a big list that displays all investors, and nothing else, plus a Close button. just to bootstrap fltk in it
and probe internal decoupling of controller interface vs. implementations.

[
@mission statement
* a tool to allow people to "invest" time/money/assets onto projects, by tracking invested stuff.
]

[
@tech/arch
* mvc-like so i can replace frontends if need be
* will start with a console TUI
* will use sqlite, users should repo-around the dumped database file
* first strike: controller-and-view console, and the backend (model) using sqlite. that's it.
]

[
@time tracker
* price per hour is out of the scope. must be negotiated later, when cashing out/accruing for reporting.
]

[
@money tracker
* with short description.
* more sophisticated stuff like inflation, monetary conversion or similar
]

[
@asset tracker
* the "last resort" tracker. intended for use with especially undilligent investors.
]

[
@tactical options:
* git-like TUI
* bolotracker --init, will spawn a new database from template.
]

[
@gui priority list
* fltk
* CEGUI
* wxwidgets
* gtk+
* qt
* tkinder+python
* could even be served via python+flask (rest api) and have a html+css frontend
]

[
@future
* publish it later
]
