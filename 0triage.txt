@mission statement
* a tool to allow people to "invest" time/money/assets onto projects, by tracking invested stuff.
]

[
@tech/arch
* mvc-like so i can replace frontends if need be
* will start with a console TUI
* will use sqlite, users should repo-around the dumped database file
* first strike: controller-and-view console, and the backend (model) using sqlite. that's it.
]

[
@time tracker
* price per hour is out of the scope. must be negotiated later, when cashing out/accruing for reporting.
]

[
@money tracker
* with short description.
* more sophisticated stuff like inflation, monetary conversion or similar
]

[
@asset tracker
* the "last resort" tracker. intended for use with especially undilligent investors.
]

[
@tactical options:
* git-like TUI
* bolotracker --init, will spawn a new database from template.
]

[
@gui debacle
* what the heck, it can have several guis if i wanted it to. So doesnt really matter now. Make a frontends folder.
* CEGUI
* fltk
* wxwidgets
* gtk+
* qt
* tkinder+python
]

[
@future
* publish it later
* try to "cloud" it later, with a web interface (html/css)
