@next up
* add test coverage for the new, pk-string based write ops

* consider refactoring all the write operations to accept the pk-strings instead of foreign keys
* everywhere where im expecting a fk, scratch that. allow a pk-string to be passed instead.
* Dont remove addition by fk, just add extra ops that accept pk strings
* then test using those, FFS (dataobjects)
